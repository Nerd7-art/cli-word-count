Repo Name: cli-word-count

# Description:
"A command-line utility written in Rust to count words, lines, and characters in a text file. This project helped me master Rust's ownership model, error handling (Result<T, E>), and file I/O operations."

Solidify understanding of Rust fundamentals: variables, functions, control flow, and working with the standard library.
